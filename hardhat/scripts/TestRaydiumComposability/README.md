# Solidity libraries for NeonEVM composability with Solana's Raydium AMM program

The composability feature allows dApps deployed on NeonEVM to interact with Solana programs, which involves formatting 
instructions in ways that are specific to each program.

Here we provide a set of Solidity libraries which make it possible to easily implement secure interactions with Solana's
Raydium AMM program.

See [Raydium AMM's Github repository](https://github.com/raydium-io/raydium-amm).
